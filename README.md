# Latterally confined growth for stem cell engineering
Transcriptome Analysis performed for the Roy et.al PNAS 2018 Paper

In the paper, we present a novel assay for reprogramming fibroblasts into iPSC-like cells in the absence of exogeous factors. Briefly, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3) were cultured such that their growth was confined on rectangular islands. After 10 days of such latterally confined growth, we observed that they acquired stem cell characteristics. In this repository, we share the scripts used to analyse the transciption profile of these samples  after 3 hours(S1), 3 days(S2), 6 days(S3) and 10 days(S4) of culture.
